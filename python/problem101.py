# This problem was asked by Alibaba.
#
# Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime 
# numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.
#
# A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture).
#
# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: 2 + 2 = 4

# If there are more than one solution possible, return the 
# lexicographically smaller solution.
# If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another 
# solution with c <= d, then [a, b] < [c, d] if 
# a < c OR a==c AND b < d.
